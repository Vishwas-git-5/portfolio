<h1>Movie Recommendations</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar is a beautiful representation of the cosmos,<br/> 
   along with the element of love added as a natural instinct of<br/> 
   human race to the science that tries to explain the dimensions.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>Good and bad are not the only two sides of a coin,<br/> 
   there's a third side that represents both, this is<br/> 
   shown as Batman, a self imposed hero tries to fight evil.</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>When a mad titan tries to help the universe by killing<br/>
   half of the world's population, the avengers must fight<br/> 
   him, to save the other half.</p>
